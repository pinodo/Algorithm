What is Implementation in algorithm?
-> Implementation is what can be come up in mind, but hard to write as a source code

Implementation examples
1. A problem that has a simple algorithm, but its code is too long
2. A problem that deal with natural number, printing the floating points are needed
3. A problem that deal with string with a certain criteria
4. A problem that proper libraries are needed

Matrix: 2D area
Unit Vector: simulation & total search
